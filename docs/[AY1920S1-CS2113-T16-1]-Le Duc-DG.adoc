== Setting Up
*  Please ensure that you have Java `11` or above installed.
*  Download the latest leduc jar file.
*  Execute the jar file with command: `[CS2113-T16-1][Le Duc].jar`

---
== Design
=== Class Diagram

Le Duc main class, called `Duke`, is composed of 4 classes : `Storage`, `Ui`, `Parser`, `TaskList`.

* `Storage` deals with saving and loading files such as the file containing the config or the file containing all the tasks.
* `Ui` deals with the interaction between the user and the program.
* `Parser` given an user's input (through Ui), the Parser will return the corresponding command
* `TaskList` represents the list containing all the tasks.

In this class diagram, constructors, getters and setters were not all represented.

The following class diagram will represent the interaction between all classes without being too specific. The class diagram for the abstract class `Command` and his concrete class is not represented because it is only one abstract class connected to a multitude of concrete class. The same goes for the `DukeException` class.

image::AllClassDiagram.png[width="1000"]

The following class diagram represents in details the abstract class `Command` with all its inherited concrete class.

== Implementation

=== Customization

The user can customize Le Duc in the following ways :

* `shortcut`: The user can implement and use shortcut for every command.
* `language`: The user can change the language for Le Duc.

==== Shortcut

The shortcut mechanism is done by the `ShortcutCommand`. As every other command, it extends Command with a HashSet containing all the command’s shortcut name and another HashSet containing all the default command’s shortcut name. Others commands include now a static attribute named shortcut that correspond to the command’s shortcut. It implements these following methods:

* `ShortcutCommand#setOneShortcut` — set the shortcut of one command
* `ShortcutCommand#initializedSetShortcut` — initialized the HashSet contains all the default command’s shortcut name

There are three cases:

* one shot one command: The user write the command for the shortcut in one line
* multi step one command: The user write which command he wants to add a shortcut to, then the console ask what is the shortcut, and the user write the name of the shortcut
* multi step every command: The user asks the console that he wants to modify all the command, and the console will show one by one every command, and the user will modify one by one each command.

When the user launches the application, the program will read the config file, then set all shortcuts to previous shortcuts that the user has decided. If the user has not decided to customized shortcuts, it will be the default shortcut.

These following diagram show how the 3 cases were implemented:

*One shot one command*

The user type the "entry" (not shown in the sequence diagram) as `shortcut CommandName ShortcutName`.

image::SDShortcutOneShot.png[width="1000"]

The method setShortcut is static, thus an object Command won’t be created

*Multi-step one command*

The user type the "entry" (not shown in the sequence diagram) as `shortcut CommandName`. Then the console will ask what will be the new name for the shortcut.

image::SGShortcutMultiOneCmd.png[width="1000"]

*Multi-step every command*

The user type the "entry" (not shown in the sequence diagram) as `shortcut`. The console will display one command's name, then the console will ask what will be the new name for the shortcut. The console will repeat until every command have a shortcut.

image::SGShortcutMultiEveryCmd.png[width="1000"]

*Consideration*

* The config file that contains all the name for the shortcut can be edit by hand, because it is faster to edit the config file than doing it via the application.
* When a command’s shortcut is set, the default shortcut can still be used

==== Language

Changing the language mechanism is done by the `LanguageCommand`. For the moment two languages are available : french and english. Only the return message after a command and the error message are changed. After typing the command to change the language, the language is changed at the next execution of the program.

The following are the steps to change a language :

* The user open Le Duc (the program).
* Le Duc create the object `ui` as an instance of `UiEn`.
* The user type `language fr` (the program is previously in english)
* The program will change the config file.
* The user exit the program.
* The user reopen Le Duc.
* Le Duc load the config file with the new language.
* Le Duc create the object `ui` as an instance of `UiFr`.
* The language of Le Duc is french.

image::languageSequenceDiagram.png[width="1000"]

In the sequence diagram, `Parser` and `Storage` should be created and destroyed when Duke is created or destroyed, but for more clarity, it was not represented.

*Consideration*

* (Current implementation) Each message displayed to the user (error or a message returned by a command) correspond to an abstract method in `Ui` and an override method in `UiFr` and `UiEn`. It was done so because it is easier to add a new language because it is sufficient to create a new class and override the method.
* (Atlernative) Make an if statement for each new language and an static attribut in `Ui`. There are less methods and less classes but if a new language is added in the future, every single command and every single exception have to be edited.

=== Modify a Task

Several commands allow the user to modify a task: `reschedule`, `postpone`, `snooze`, `edit` and `prioritize`.
As every other command, these commands extend Command.
As these commands relate to the modification of tasks, each command need to write into the data file after its execution.

==== *Reschedule an event task*

When rescheduling an event, two dates can’t clash. This verification is done with the verifyConflictDate method which is
in the TaskList class. Indeed, all task dates are needed to verify if there is a conflict. So, this allows to improve the cohesion.

image::SequenceDiagramReschedule.png[width="1000", align="center"]

==== *Snooze an homework task*

Snooze is applicable to a homework task. The snooze time is fixed at 30 minutes( it could be easily changed in the snoozeLocalDateTime() method of Date.

image::SequenceDiagramSnooze.png[width="1000", align="center"]

==== *Postpone an homework task*

Postpone is also only applicable to a homework task. The new date should be after the old one.
This is verified inside the execution of the postponeCommand.

image::SequenceDiagramPostpone.png[width="1000", align="center"]

==== *Edit a task*

* Multi-steps command: to edit a task, the user has to follow these instructions:

1. `edit`
2. All of the tasks will be displayed, you have to choose a task INDEX
3. Depending on the type of task:
** If it is a todo task, you have to enter the new DESCRIPTION
** If it is not a todo task, you have to choose 1) if you want to edit the description or 2) if you want to edit the date
- Then, enter the new DESCRIPTION or the new DATE of the task

The sequence diagram shows the interactions between different classes when the user want to edit the description an homework or event task with a multi-steps edit command.

image::SequenceDiagramEditMultiSteps.png[width="1000", align="center"]


* For one shot command:
- edit the description: `edit INDEX description DESCRIPTION`
- edit the date of an homework task: `edit INDEX /by DATE`
- edit the period of an event task: `edit INDEX /at DATE - DATE`

The sequence diagram shows the interactions between different classes when the user input `edit 2 description DESCRIPTION`.

image::SequenceDiagramEditOneShot.png[width="1000", align="center"]

==== *Prioritize a task*

A task has initially a priority of 5. The priority of a task goes from 1 to 9.
This command allows the user to change the priority of a task.

The sequence diagram show the interactions between different classes when the user wants to change to priority of the first task to 2.

image::SequenceDiagramPrioritize.png[width="1000", align="center"]

==== Consideration

There are two different commands for modifying the priority ( `prioritize`) and the description/date (`edit`) o f a task. Indeed, the edit command is considered to be used when a user have initially created a incorrect task, whereas the prioritize command is supposed to be used regularly as the priority of a task generally increase with the time.
However, these two commands are obviously easy to combine into one command.


=== Sort the task list

Sort all task by date/description/priority/type of task/ done or not: `sort SORTTYPE`
SORTTYPE is either date, description, priority, type, done

* Sorting by date will sort tasks in chronological order
* Sorting by description will sort the descriptions in alphabetical order
* Sorting by priority will sort tasks in ascending urgency
* Sorting by type will sort tasks depending on its task type ( event, homework, todo)
* Sorting by done will sort tasks depending on it the task is done or not.

To implement the sort command, the comparing static method of Comparator interface introduced in Java 8 is used.
So, here the sort key are the desciption or the priority of the task.


=== Remind


The Remind feature is done by the RemindCommand. Along with all of the other implemented commands, it extends Command. The feature will process each tasks date/timestamps to order them, and then remind the user of the 3 earliest, unfinished tasks. The following methods were implemented in this feature:

* `filterTasks` - Extracts the Homework and Event tasks into a seperate ArrayList
* `sort` - Orders the filtered TaskList in chronological order.

* *Sequence Diagram of the Remind Feature:*

image::RemindSequenceDiagram.png[width="1200"]
There are 4 cases:

* TaskList contains only Homework and Event objects
* TaskList contains only Todo objects
* TaskList contains a mix of all objects
* TaskList contains no objects

The task of sorting the tasklist in chronological order becomes challenging as not all tasks have associated timestamps.
This problem is divided into 4 subproblems, each of which are handled seperately.


==== TaskList contains only Homework/Event tasks

* The original TaskList is passed through a filter to isolate the Homework and Event tasks.
* The TaskList.extractTodo() method will attempt to isolate all Todo tasks. It will return an empty array in this case
* After filtering by TaskList.filterTasks(), the filtered TaskList will be equal to the original TaskList, as there are no Todo objects to filter out in this particular case.
* The filtered TaskList will then be sorted by TaskList.sort().
* The sort() method will call each tasks task.getDate() method in preparation for sorting. For "Event" tasks, the first timestamp will be used for the purposes of sorting.
* After performing insertion sort, the array of Todo's will be appended to the end of the sorted list. In this case, there are no
"todo" tasks, so nothing will be appended.
* The first 3 most upcoming tasks will be displayed to the user.
* *Output:*

```---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
remind
1. [H][X] d1 by: 14/09/2019 22:33 [Priority: 5]
2. [E][X] e1 at: 21/09/2019 00:00 - 28/10/2019 22:22 [Priority: 5]
3. [H][X] d2 by: 22/09/2019 22:33 [Priority: 5]
```
==== TaskList only contains Todo tasks

* The original TaskList is passed through a filter to isolate the Homework and Event tasks. Because there are only Todo tasks, it will return an empty array.
* The TaskList.extractTodo() method will attempt to isolate all todo tasks. It will return the original tasklist in this case, becase every task is a "todo"
* The filtered TaskList will then be sorted by TaskList.sort(). The method will return an empty array, because the input array containing Homework and Event tasks is empty.
* The sort method will return an empty array, as the input array of Homework/Event tasks is empty in this case.
* The array of Todo's is appended to the empty, returned array from TaskList.sort(), resulting in the original tasklist of only Todo tasks.
* *The original tasklist is considered to be the sorted tasklist. The order in which the Todo's were created is treated as an  "implicit order".*
* The first 3 most upcoming tasks will be displayed to the user.
* *Output:*
```---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
remind
1. [T][X] todo1 [Priority: 5]
2. [T][X] todo2 [Priority: 5]
3. [T][X] todo3 [Priority: 5]
```
==== TaskList contains a mix of all task types

* The original TaskList is passed through a filter to isolate the Homework and Event tasks.
* The TaskList.extractTodo() method will attempt to isolate all todo tasks. It will return an array of all todo's in this case
* After filtering by TaskList.filterTasks(), the filtered TaskList will contain only Homework and Event tasks.
* The filtered TaskList will then be sorted by TaskList.sort().
* The sort() method will call each tasks task.getDate() method in preparation for sorting. For "Event" tasks, the first timestamp will be used for the purposes of sorting.
* After performing insertion sort, the array of Todo's will be appended to the end of the sortedlist. If a task is a "todo" it is assumed that it has a "soft deadline" unlike a Homework task.
Therefore, it is pushed to the bottom of the sorted tasklist.
* The first 3 most upcoming tasks will be displayed to the user.
* *Output:*

```---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
remind
1. [H][X] d1 by: 14/09/2019 22:33 [Priority: 5]
2. [E][X] e1 at: 21/09/2019 00:00 - 28/10/2019 22:22 [Priority: 5]
3. [T][X] t1 [Priority: 5]
```
==== TaskList Contains No Objects

```
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    There are no upcoming tasks in your list
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

```

==== Consideration
* Sorting the TaskList in place was considered, but it reduced cohesion of the design, as the same function is reused by other features.
* It was considered to only remind the user of tasks that are coming up in the next week,
but that would limit its potential utility

=== G.19. Prioritize:  `prioritize`

Giving priority to task: `prioritize INDEX prio INDEX`

The first INDEX is the task index

The second INDEX is the priority (goes from 1 to 9)

Be careful:

* The second INDEX can’t be less than 1 nor greater than 9.
* 1 is the less urgent, 9 is the most urgent
* When creating a task, specifying the priority is optional. When the priority is not specified, the task will automatically have a priority of 5.

Example:

* `prioritize 4 prio 2`
* `prioritize 5 prio 8`

---

* Test Case `prioritize 4 prio 2`
** Expected:
*** modify the priority of the number 4 task to 2

```
	---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	 Got it. I've set the priority of this task:
	   [T][V] Software security: lab 6: exercice 2 [Priority: 2]
	---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

=== G.20. Display by day/week/month: `show`

Display all the task for one particular day/week/month: `show DATETYPE DATE`

DATETYPE is day, dayofweek, today, week, month, year.

The DATE argument depends on the DATETYPE

* day :
** shows all the tasks for the given date
** DATE : DD/MM/YYYY

* dayofweek :
** shows all the tasks for the given day of week
** DATE : monday, tuesday, wednesday, thursday, friday, saturday, sunday

* today :
** shows all the tasks for the user's today
** DATE : nothing should be written !!

* week :
** shows all the tasks, starting from user's today to 7 days later (the last days is not included)
** DATE : nothing should be written !!

* month :
** shows all the tasks for the given month
** DATE : MM/YYYY

* year
** shows all the tasks for the given year
** DATE : YYYY

There are two behaviour, one line command and multi-step command

Example (one line command) :

* `show day 29/10/2019`
* `show dayofweek monday`
* `show today`
* `show week`
* `show month 10/2019`
* `show year 2019`

Example (multi-step command) :

* `show day`

* The console ask to enter the day :

* `29/10/2019`

or

* `show dayofweek`

* The program ask to enter the day :

* `monday`

---

* Test Case `show day 09/11/2019`
** Expected:

=== G.21. Shortcut : `shortcut`

Give shortcut to command : `shortcut COMMANDNAME SHORTCUTNAME`

COMMANDNAME is the name of the command (like todo, sort, show ...)

SHORTCUTNAME is the new shortcut name for the command

There are three behaviour : One line command, multi-step command, multi-step customize all command

Be careful :

* There can't be 2 same shortcut name.
* The shortcut name can't be the same as one of the default command name (for example, the shortcut name can't be todo because it is a default command name).



Example (One line command) :

* `shortcut todo t`
* `shortcut prioritize prio`

Example (multi-step command) :

* `shortcut todo`
* The program ask to enter the shortcut
* `t`

Example (multi-step customize all command)

* `shortcut`
* The program enter in customize shortcut mode
* The program display the first command with his shortcut and ask to enter for a new shortcut name
* `shortcutname`
* The program display the first command with his shortcut and ask to enter for a new shortcut name
* `shortcutname2`
* ...
* The program display all the shortcut


Be careful :

* There can't be 2 same shortcut name. If we enter a shortcut that already exists, we are in one line command or multi-step command behaviour, it will show an error, and if we are in multi-step customize all command, it will ask again.
* The shortcut name can't be the same as one of the default command name (for example, the shortcut name can't be todo because it is a default command name).

For each command, the console will output the command name.

The user (you) have to input the shortcut you want.

If the shortcut already exists, the console will tell you to assign another shortcut
